## About Me

I am **~K’**, a systems-oriented developer with a strong interest in language engineering, tooling, and low-level software design.

My work focuses on making complex systems understandable — through clear semantics, intentional abstractions, and predictable behavior. I’m especially interested in problems where correctness, structure, and long-term maintainability matter more than speed of delivery.

I tend to work close to the foundations: **parsing, program structure, build systems, runtimes, and developer-facing tooling.**

I’m most engaged when the problem requires deep reasoning and trade-off analysis rather than surface-level solutions.

## Current Focus

I actively work on experimental and production-grade tools related to:

* Language infrastructure
* Compilers and interpreters
* Command-line tooling
* Build and release systems
* Backend-oriented system components

One of my ongoing projects explores **polyglot language interoperability**, aiming to bridge ecosystems rather than replace them. Other projects focus on tooling reliability, automation, and developer ergonomics.

> Projects evolve; principles stay.

## Technical Interests

* Language design and semantics
* Lexical and syntactic analysis
* AST modeling and program representation
* Multi-stage and multipass compilation
* Interoperability between ecosystems
* CLI tools and backend systems
* Low-level abstractions with high-level intent

---

## Core Stack

* **Languages:** Java, Zig, Python, Rust, Bash
* **Data & Frameworks:** Spring, PostgreSQL, MySQL
* **Env:** Git, GitHub / Codeberg, Unix-like systems

*(Technology is a tool, not an identity.)*

## Notes

Most of my repositories are experiments, tools, or long-term explorations.
**I value clarity, intent, and correctness over trend-following.**
