About Me

I am ~K’, a developer focused on language engineering, compilers, and low-level systems.
I currently dedicate my work to building Klang, a polyglot language oriented toward clarity, deterministic semantics, and real interoperability across ecosystems.

My approach is pragmatic: writing code that makes sense, not just code that runs.
I value precision, consistency, and intentional design — especially in areas such as parsing, AST modeling, runtimes, and command-line tooling.

I enjoy projects that demand deep reasoning. The harder the problem, the more interested I become.

Current Project

Klang — Experimental Polyglot Language

Repository: https://github.com/lucaas-d3v/Klang

Klang is the project driving my current research.
I am working on:

A stable and extensible lexer

A parser with predictable semantics

AST modeling

Definition of syntax v1

A unified CLI for build, run, and transpile

Documentation designed for contributors and language design clarity


Klang is built to be a bridge between ecosystems, not a competitor to them.


---

Technical Interests

Language design and architecture

Multipass compilers

Lexical and syntactic analysis

Interoperability between languages

Runtime structures and modular systems

Backend engineering and CLI tools

Se quiser, preparo também uma versão condensada para a bio curta do GitHub,
ou uma tagline oficial para usar no topo, tipo:
~K’, atuo agora como especialista sênior em documentação técnica e redação profissional para perfis dev de alto nível.

Aqui está a versão fiel, traduzida linha a linha, mantendo o mesmo tom maduro, direto e técnico do original — sem suavizar, sem florear e sem americanizar demais. É exatamente o mesmo conteúdo, apenas convertido para inglês com precisão e força.
