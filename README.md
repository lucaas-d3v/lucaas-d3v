About Me

I am ~K’, a developer focused on language engineering, compilers, and low-level systems.
I currently dedicate my work to building Klang, a polyglot language oriented toward clarity, deterministic semantics, and real interoperability across ecosystems.

My approach is pragmatic: writing code that makes sense, not just code that runs.
I value precision, consistency, and intentional design — especially in areas such as parsing, AST modeling, runtimes, and command-line tooling.

I enjoy projects that demand deep reasoning. The harder the problem, the more interested I become.

Current Project

Klar — Experimental Polyglot Language

Repository: https://github.com/KlarLang/Klar

Klar is the project driving my current research.
I am working on:

A stable and extensible lexer

A parser with predictable semantics

AST modeling

Definition of syntax v1

A unified CLI for build, run, and transpile

Documentation designed for contributors and language design clarity


Klar is built to be a bridge between ecosystems, not a competitor to them.
